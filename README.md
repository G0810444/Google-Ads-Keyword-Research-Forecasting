ðŸ“Š Keyword Research & Forecasting for Google Ads
ðŸ§  About This Project
This is a very important subject for me â€” Google Ads is what got me interested in data science in the first place. Over the past four years, my keyword research and forecasting process has been praised and refined through hands-on experience in managing ad accounts.

This project walks you through my exact workflow for conducting keyword research and forecasting campaign performance â€” using only free tools. My goal is to help others understand how to create strategic ad projections rooted in real business KPIs and high-intent search behavior.
