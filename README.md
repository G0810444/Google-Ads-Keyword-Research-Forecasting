# Google-Ads-Keyword-Research-Forecasting
This project documents a real-world process for Google Ads keyword research and forecasting, built over four years of managing ad accounts. It’s designed for marketers, analysts, or business owners who want accurate, high-intent forecasting without using paid tools.

You'll learn:

How to research high-intent keywords using Google Keyword Planner

How to filter, clean, and segment keywords

How to forecast performance using your own Google Sheets model

Why custom forecasting is more accurate than Google’s native tool — especially when you include metrics like close rates, AOV, profit margins, and remarketing

No paid tools required. Just strategy, data, and smart projections.
