📊 Keyword Research & Forecasting for Google Ads
🧠 About This Project
This is a very important subject for me — Google Ads is what got me interested in data science in the first place. Over the past four years, my keyword research and forecasting process has been praised and refined through hands-on experience in managing ad accounts.

This project walks you through my exact workflow for conducting keyword research and forecasting campaign performance — using only free tools. My goal is to help others understand how to create strategic ad projections rooted in real business KPIs and high-intent search behavior.

🔍 Why Not Just Use Paid Tools?
Many paid tools are great, but they often lack the granular data that Google itself provides — which is readily accessible through Google Keyword Planner. In fact, Google Ads is all about high-intent keywords that match the way customers search for your specific business offering.

✅ What This Project Covers
Keyword research using Google Keyword Planner

Understanding keyword intent

Cleaning and refining keyword lists

Creating a custom Google Ads forecast using actual sales KPIs

Incorporating remarketing spend and sales performance

Building a practical projection model in Google Sheets

🔧 Tools Used
Google Keyword Planner (free)

Google Sheets (custom projection template)

Optional: Ed Leake's forecasting sheet (credited below)

🗂 Step-by-Step Guide
1. Start with Business Context
Before jumping into keywords, make sure you have clarity on:

What your business offers

Who your target audience is

What region(s) you’re targeting

2. Begin Keyword Research
We’ll use the example of a real furniture company called Sofa Mania, which is exploring selling dog beds as a new product.

Using Google Keyword Planner:
Go to Discover New Keywords

Input a base term, e.g., "dog bed"

Set your location targeting (make sure it matches your actual business goals)

Filter for Google Search Network only

Use filters to show only keywords with 100+ monthly searches

Use the Refine Keywords panel to remove:

Services you don’t offer

Brand names

Other irrelevant terms

Save High-Intent Keywords Only
We’re interested in transactional intent, not navigational or informational.

Type	Example	Use it?
Navigational	petco dog beds	❌
Informational	how to choose a dog bed	❌
Transactional	dog bed for sale	✅
💡 Tip: Add irrelevant or misleading keywords to your negative keyword list (e.g., anything with <50 impressions).

3. Forecasting Performance
Now that you've built your keyword list:

Go to:
Get Search Volume and Forecasts in Keyword Planner

Why not use Google's native forecast? Because it doesn’t account for:

Sales close rate

Revenue per sale

Profit margins

Remarketing performance

Your actual ad KPIs

That’s why I use a custom Google Ads projection sheet that gives a more accurate view.

4. Building the Forecast Sheet
Paste your keyword list into Keyword Planner’s forecast section to get:

Avg. monthly searches

Competition

Competition index

Top of page bid ranges (low and high)

Transfer that data into the Input Page of your forecasting sheet.

Head to the Projections Page and fill in your known or estimated KPIs, such as:

CTR (Click-Through Rate)

CVR (Conversion Rate)

Revenue per sale

Close rate

Remarketing %

📊 The Forecasting Sheet
The projection sheet I use is inspired by Ed Leake’s well-known model. Credit to him for building the foundation. I’ve customized it to:

Include remarketing spend

Focus on real business KPIs

Separate performance by intent and funnel stage

🧾 Future Plans
Add an automated Google Ads API version

Integrate keyword clustering by intent and category
